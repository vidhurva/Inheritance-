# Inheritance-
C++ Inheritance Program 

// In this program, I used inheritances along with class to calculate the cost of paint required to change a room's coloe.
// Note that teh protected class occurs after the public class but is in the class loop.
// The dimesnions of the width, height and length are already in the program.
// Additionally, there is a total area calculator and a total paint cost calculator.

In the class shape, everything is able to access public. 
However, only the "spawn" (function that is inherited from shape) has access to protected.
